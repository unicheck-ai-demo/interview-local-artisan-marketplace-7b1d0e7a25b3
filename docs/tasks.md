## Task 1: Order Total Calculation Bug

Customers are reporting that the total cost of their orders is lower than expected when they purchase multiple items. For instance, ordering 2 of one product priced at $10 and 3 of another priced at $5 results in a total of $15 instead of the expected $35. Investigate and correct the issue so that the displayed total amount always accurately reflects the combined cost of all items in the order.
